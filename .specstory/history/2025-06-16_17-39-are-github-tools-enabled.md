are github tools enabled?

_**Assistant**_

No, I don't have any specific GitHub tools enabled. My available tools are:

- File operations (read, edit, search, delete)
- Terminal commands (which could include git)
- Codebase/code search
- Web search
- Diagram creation
- Notebook editing

If you need GitHub functionality, I can run git commands via terminal or help with GitHub API calls through web requests, but there aren't dedicated GitHub integration tools.
