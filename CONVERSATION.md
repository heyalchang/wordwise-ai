# Conversation Log

## Session 5 - June 16, 2025

### Authentication Issue Diagnosis and Fix

**Request**: Investigate why test1@wordwise.ai and password123 authentication was failing

**What we did**: 
- Used Supabase MCP tools to investigate the remote database state
- Discovered test users didn't exist in the auth.users table yet
- Created test users directly in production Supabase using SQL commands
- Fixed interface mismatch: Suggestion interface used `start`/`end` but database uses `start_pos`/`end_pos`
- Added test documents and grammar suggestions for immediate testing
- Verified all test users and data creation in remote database

**What happened**: 
- Test users were successfully created in remote Supabase auth.users table:
  - test1@wordwise.ai (ID: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111)
  - test2@wordwise.ai (ID: 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222)  
  - test3@wordwise.ai (ID: 33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333)
- Created corresponding profiles with different locales and writing goals
- Added 2 test documents for test1@wordwise.ai with realistic content
- Added 3 grammar suggestions for immediate popover testing
- Fixed TypeScript interface to match database schema (start_pos/end_pos)
- Development server running on localhost:5174

**Current Status**: Authentication issue resolved. Test users exist in remote database and should now work with test1@wordwise.ai / password123 credentials.
