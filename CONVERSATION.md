### Setup GitHub Repository and Project Structure

**Request**: Setup a GitHub project and push to origin, then move all files from wordwise-ai subdirectory to main directory.

**What we did**: 
- Created GitHub repository "wordwise-ai" with comprehensive description
- Initialized git repository and made initial commit with documentation
- Discovered Vite had created files in a subdirectory, restructured project by moving all files to root level
- Set up complete development environment with Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint/Prettier
- Installed all core dependencies: Tiptap editor, Supabase client, Zustand, React Router, Headless UI

**What happened**: 
- Successfully restructured project with cleaner file organization
- All linting and type checking now passes
- Development server runs correctly on localhost:5173
- Created CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and Vercel deployment
- Set up project folder structure following technical specification (src/editor, src/store, src/components, src/pages)

**Current Status**: Day 1 infrastructure complete, ready for Day 2 authentication and database setup.
